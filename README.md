LLM Engineering - Mastering AI, building Large Language Models & Agents

I'm using LangChain framework with ollam3.1 Meta models to build Agentic AI using multi-modality and RAG agents.

Other LLMs are also used in these examples using OpenAPI, Anthropic - Claude, Ali Baba's - Qwen, DeepSeek, Google Gemini and Gemma.

I'm using Huggingface to connect to above LLMs and also using their Dataset and spaces to build RAG and host Gradio Spaces.
